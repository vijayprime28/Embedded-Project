DOOR ACCESSING USING RFID WITH SIMPLE AUTOMATION

The project aims to enhance home security and comfort by integrating various sensors and devices. 
When a person approaches the door, the PIR motion sensor detects their presence and prompts them to scan an RFID tag on the LCD. 
If the correct RFID tag is scanned, the servo motor unlocks the door and displays "Access Granted" on the LCD. 
If an incorrect RFID tag is scanned, "Access Denied" is displayed. 
When there is no motion detected, the system displays "Door is Locked" on the LCD. 
Additionally, based on real-time temperature and humidity readings from the sensor,the system should intelligently control a fan, ensuring optimal environmental conditions (e.g., turning on the fan if the temperature is 33 degrees Celsius and humidity is 51.80%). 
Finally, an LED should indicate the system's operational status.
